# Welcome to the Water Test Network(WTN)
Due to weak government environmental regulations and oversight and the recent devastating discoveries of high levels of iron in the water in Flint Michigan, we are forming the Water Test Network.  Citizens who are concerned about keeping our water free of toxins are encouraged to join our group, we need volunteers to test all soureces of fresh water like city water, wells, streams, rivers, and lakes and then post the results to our website.  The water test results will be analyzed and displayed on our website.

WE CAN'T DEPEND ON GOVERNEMENT, CORPORATIONS, OR FARMS TO KEEP OUR WATERS CLEAN!  IT'S UP TO YOU AND ME!
