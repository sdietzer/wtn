# Welcome to the Water Test Network(WTN)
Due to weak government environmental regulations and oversight and the devastating discoveries of high levels of iron in the water in Flint Michigan, we the people here by for the Water Test Network which consists of citizens who are concerned about keeping our water free of toxins.  We need volunteers to test the water of all waters sources like city water, wells, streams, rivers, and lakes and then post the results to our website.  The water test results will be analyzed and displayed on our website.

WE CAN'T DEPEND ON GOV's, CORP's, OR FARM's TO KEEP OUR WATERS CLEAN!  IT's UP TO US!
